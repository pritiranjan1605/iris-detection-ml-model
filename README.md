# Iris Detection ML Model

This repository contains a machine learning model developed for iris detection based on sepal and petal length and width. The model is built using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn.

## Dataset
The model is trained on the famous Iris dataset, which is included in scikit-learn. The dataset contains measurements of sepal and petal lengths and widths for three species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Model Training
The model is trained using various classification algorithms, including but not limited to:
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

The training process involves splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, fitting the model to the training data, and evaluating its performance using the testing data.

## Usage
To use the model, follow these steps:
1. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
2. Run the provided Python script to load the dataset, train the model, and make predictions.
3. Provide input values for sepal and petal length and width to get the predicted iris species.

## Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into how well the model generalizes to unseen data and its ability to correctly classify iris species based on the input features.
